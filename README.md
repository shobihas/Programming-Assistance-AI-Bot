# Programming-Assistance-AI-BotðŸ¤–
A Programming Assistance AI Bot using the LLaMA model, hosted locally, to help students with programming queries.

ðŸŽ¯**Objective**

The primary goal of this project was to create a locally-hosted Programming Assistance AI Bot using the LLaMA model to aid students in improving their programming skills.

ðŸŽ¯**Key Features**

1._Interactive Query Handling_: Students can ask about Python, Java, and C++ programming concepts.

2._Algorithm Explanations_: Simplifies complex algorithms with examples.

3._Code Debugging and Optimization:_ Guides students in resolving and refining code issues.

4._Practice Problem Suggestions:_ Encourages learning through curated programming exercises.

ðŸŽ¯**How to work**

1.Install the required librabries : Flask, LLama3 Model from ollama ,logging , json ,flask_cors

2.Run the app.py file using flask server.

   
ðŸŽ¯**Implementation**

1._Backend:_ Flask-based API to handle user requests and integrate with the LLaMA model using Ollama.

2._Frontend:_ A simple HTML and JavaScript interface for user interaction.

3._Model:_Utilized the LLaMA3 model hosted locally for cost-effective and fast responses.


ðŸŽ¯**Challenges**

1._Integration with LLaMA:_ Ensuring smooth communication between Flask and Ollama for generating responses.

2._Error Handling:_ Anticipating and managing a variety of user errors and exceptions.

3._Performance:_ Optimizing API responses to ensure timely feedback.

ðŸŽ¯**Outcome**

The bot successfully assists students with their programming-related queries and serves as a valuable tool for self-learning. It is efficient, interactive, and extensible for future improvements.
