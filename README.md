# Programming-Assistance-AI-Bot
A Programming Assistance AI Bot using the LLaMA model, hosted locally, to help students with programming queries.

**Objective`**
The primary goal of this project was to create a locally-hosted Programming Assistance AI Bot using the LLaMA model to aid students in improving their programming skills.

**Key Features**
1._Interactive Query Handling_: Students can ask about Python, Java, and C++ programming concepts.
2._Algorithm Explanations_: Simplifies complex algorithms with examples.
3._Code Debugging and Optimization:_ Guides students in resolving and refining code issues.
4._Practice Problem Suggestions:_ Encourages learning through curated programming exercises.

**Implementation**
1.**Backend:** Flask-based API to handle user requests and integrate with the LLaMA model using Ollama.
2.**Frontend:** A simple HTML and JavaScript interface for user interaction.
3.**Model:** Utilized the LLaMA3 model hosted locally for cost-effective and fast responses.

**Challenges**
1.Integration with LLaMA: Ensuring smooth communication between Flask and Ollama for generating responses.
2.Error Handling: Anticipating and managing a variety of user errors and exceptions.
3.Performance: Optimizing API responses to ensure timely feedback.

**Outcome**
The bot successfully assists students with their programming-related queries and serves as a valuable tool for self-learning. It is efficient, interactive, and extensible for future improvements.
